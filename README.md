# <Note-Taker>

## Description


My motivation was to help people stay organized and get there tasks done in a prioritized way.
I built this project so business people could take notes and keep track of the tasks they need to get done.
This solves the problem of wasting time figuring out what the user wants to get done, when and how and it helps give the user a better direction and use their time more wisely.
I learned how to setup routes and connect them to the front end.
